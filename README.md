# Featurefetch

Get and sort features from gtfs. Example query: give me all the introns, sorted
by gene length where the introns are split into quartiles by gene length. Many
more to come.

Will grow organically as I need features, not rushing to finish this.

## TODO:

* Add feature TSS
* Fix intron code
* Add ways to remove all but one transcript for each gene
* Add ways to remove genes with overlapping TSS.
* Add more splits
